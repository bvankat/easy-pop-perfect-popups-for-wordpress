## Frequently Asked Questions

= Can I use any WordPress blocks in my modals? =

Yes! The modal content area supports all WordPress blocks, including third-party blocks from other plugins.

= How does the frequency control work? =

The plugin uses cookies to track when a modal has been shown. Based on your settings, it will respect the display frequency you've chosen.

= Can I have multiple modals on the same page? =

Yes, you can create as many modals as you need. Each modal's trigger conditions are evaluated independently.

= Is the modal accessible? =

Absolutely! The modal includes proper ARIA labels, focus trapping, keyboard navigation (ESC to close), and focus restoration when closed.

= Does it work on mobile devices? =

Yes! The modal is fully responsive and you can even choose to show modals only on specific device types.

= How do I trigger a modal on button click? =

Set the trigger to "Click" and provide a CSS selector (like ".open-modal-button" or "#special-offer-btn"). Any element matching that selector will open the modal when clicked.

= Can I customize the modal styling? =

Yes! The modal uses minimal base styles, and you can add custom CSS to match your site's design. The modal content inherits your theme's block styles.

= Does it impact site performance? =

No! The plugin is optimized for performance with minimal JavaScript (under 3KB) and CSS. Modals only load the resources they need.
